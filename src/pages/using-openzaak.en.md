## Using OpenZaak

Since mid-2020, OpenZaak is also available to other municipalities and governments in the Netherlands.

Would you like to know more about how you can start using OpenZaak in your municipality? Please [contact](/en/contact/) us for an (online) demo of Signalen.

## For developers
OpenZaak is an open source case register API backend for municipalites who want to deliver citizen-friendly services online.

OpenZaak implements the national API standards for case-oriented working ([ZGW API's](https://github.com/VNG-Realisatie/gemma-zaken)) developed by [VNG Realisatie](https://www.vngrealisatie.nl/). In order to fully utilize OpenZaak it needs to connect with other systems or components. Document management systems, or specialized systems to handle permits as well as the case handling component, MyApp or apps for MOR reports are examples of such systems and components.

OpenZaak consists of backend (storage and retrieval) and API (service) provisioning layer (authorization and authentication) for the national Zaak Gericht Werken API.

OpenZaak is further developed in an open source project by an open and active community of municipalities, vendors and software developers and welcomes everyone who wants to participate and contribute towards making OpenZaak better. On our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak) you can learn [how to get started](https://open-zaak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/index.html#installation-index) and how to [contribute](https://github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
