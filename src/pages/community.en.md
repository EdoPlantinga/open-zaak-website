## Community

OpenZaak has been applied to the design principles of [Common Ground](https://www.commonground.nl), making it quickly, easily and safely available to municipalities in the Netherlands. OpenZaak is optimized for the [Haven reference implementation](https://haven.commonground.nl), the standard cloud-agnostic infrastructure used for all Common Ground initiatives.

[Common Ground](https://www.commonground.nl) stands for a new, modern, joint information provision for municipalities. Where data is seperated from work processes and applications. And where data is used multiple times at the source. In essence, that is the basic premise of Common Ground. A radical reform of the provision of information, which requires a new way of collaboration between municipalities and the market.

### Who owns the OpenZaak?

The OpenZaak code is public and you cannot speak so much about ownership but rather about who is the maintainer of OpenZaak. OpenZaak was initially developed by [Maykin Media B.V.](https://www.maykinmedia.nl/) and commissioned by the municipalities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht, Tilburg, Arnhem, Haarlem, â€˜s-Hertogenbosch, Delft and a coalition of Hoorn, Medemblik, Stede Broec, Drechteland, Enkhuizen (SED) under direction of [Dimpact](https://www.dimpact.nl/). The [OpenZaak code](https://github.com/open-zaak/) is currently managed by the OpenZaak community and they are faciliated by "Code Stewards" of the [Foundation for Public Code](https://publiccode.net).

### Working together on OpenZaak
