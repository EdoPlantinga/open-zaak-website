## Common Ground

[Common Ground](https://www.commonground.nl) stands for a new, modern, joint information provision for municipalities. Where data is seperated from work processes and applications. And where data is used multiple times at the source. In essence, that is the basic premise of Common Ground. A radical reform of the provision of information, which requires a new way of collaboration between municipalities and the market.

### Share

Because OpenZaak has been developed with public funds, the municipality of Amsterdam considers it important to share its findings and results with other municipalities in the Netherlands.

### OpenZaak and Common Ground

OpenZaak has been applied to the design principles of Common Ground, making it quickly, easily and safely available to municipalities in the Netherlands. Signalen is optimized for the [Haven reference implementation](https://haven.commonground.nl), the standard cloud-agnostic infrastructure used for all Common Ground initiatives.

### Who owns the OpenZaak?

The OpenZaak code is public and you cannot speak so much about ownership but rather about who is the maintainer of OpenZaak. OpenZaak was initially developed by Maykin Media B.V. and commissioned by Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht, Tilburg, Arnhem, Haarlem, â€˜s-Hertogenbosch, Delft and a coalition of Hoorn, Medemblik, Stede Broec, Drechteland, Enkhuizen (SED) under direction of Dimpact. The OpenZaak code is currently managed by the OpenZaak community and they are faciliated by "Code Stewards" of the Foundation for Public Code.

### Working together on OpenZaak

In collaboration with Dimpact, The OpenZaak community and facilitated by the Foundation for Public Code, OpenZaak has been made accessible to every municipality in the Netherlands.

In accordance with the principles of open source, anyone can submit suggestions for adapting or improving the software. Using OpenZaak together and improving OpenZaak together. In this way, we work together to improve customer satisfaction and the quality of online services in our municipalities.
