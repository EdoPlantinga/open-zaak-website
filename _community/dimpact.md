@TODO add official text

Dimpact is from municipalities and is for municipalities. Our members have a shared ambition: to initiate and realize solutions for the public services of tomorrow.

All members own our cooperative. They jointly manage our developments. Collaboration, knowledge sharing and reuse of solutions are the basis for this.
