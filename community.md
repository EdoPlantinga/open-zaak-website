<h2>The OpenZaak community</h2>
<p>Like many other open sources codebases, the OpenZaak community is made up of people from a wide variety of affiliations.
There are multiple vendors that can supply services and contibutes with development.
Several municiaplities are working on implementing OpenZaak and a few already have it in prodcution.
And then there are organizations like Dimpact and the Foundation for Public Code that helps coordinating and overseeing the codebase.
We like this community to grow, do you want to join us?</p>

<p>The governance of the codebase is handled through the technical steering team and the product steering team. Both are described in the <a href="https://github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md">governance document</a>.</p>
