OpenZaak is an open-source case register platform for municipalites who want to deliver citizen-friendly services online.

Municipalities need a new, modern information architecture to be able to register and manage cases and documents in order to support their core tasks. Cases are requests which involve a standardized proces in order to handle these requests. Cases could be citizens requiring a renewal of their passport, drivers license or needing a permit to organize an event.

The current information architecture makes it difficult for municipalities to securely exchange data in their own backoffice or between other municipalities. The current systems are lacking the flexibility to quickly adept and innovate in order to implement rapid change in public policy and serve the changing needs of it's citizens. This makes maintaining and altering exisiting software increasing slow and expensive resulting in a lower quality of service with increased costs. OpenZaak was developped to solve this problem helping municipalities increase their level of service and lower the cost of ownership.

OpenZaak itself is not a case management or document management solution but rather a ready-to-use backend solution which functions as a directory of case registration including meta data describing the case. OpenZaak implements the national API standards for case-oriented working ([ZGW API's](https://www.vngrealisatie.nl/producten/api-standaarden-zaakgericht-werken)) developed by [[VNG Realisatie](https://www.vngrealisatie.nl/)](https://www.vngrealisatie.nl/). In order to fully utilize OpenZaak it needs to connect with other systems or components. Document management systems, or specialized systems to handle permits as well as the case handling component, MyApp or apps for MOR reports are examples of such systems and components.

OpenZaak originally was developed by Maykin Media B.V. commissioned by Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht, Tilburg, Arnhem, Haarlem, 's-Hertogenbosch, Delft and a coalition of Hoorn, Medemblik, Stede Broec, Drechteland, Enkhuizen (SED), directed by [Dimpact](https://www.dimpact.nl/).

In addition to Utrecht, Haarlem, Arnhem, Den Bosch, Tilburg, Delft, Medemblik, SED - Stedebroec, Enkhuizen and Drechterland-, Hoorn, Rotterdam and Amsterdam also participate.

OpenZaak is already being deployed and used by the Gemeente Utrecht, Haarlem and Amsterdam. A number of vendors (such as Tiltshift/Maykin/Condution/Excellence) are currently at work implementing OpenZaak. Dimpact is in the process of issuing bite-sized procurements for OpenZaak to get OpenZaak adopted and used withing Dimpact member municipalities.

## What kind of OpenZaak service do I need consider?

This depends on your needs. Maybe you just started thinking about implementing OpenZaak in your municipality or you already have it up and running but need custom integration with your website or document management system. Or maybe you want to outsource everything to a vendor who can implement and maintain an OpenZaak installation for your municipality.

If you are new to OpenZaak a good idea is to start learning from the experience from other municipalities. On the OpenZaak website there are a number of [use cases](#usecases) where you can read about how other municipalities use and implement OpenZaak.

If you are a small-sized municipality you could join a group of existing smaller municipalities who work together using a shared OpenZaak infrastructure.  [@todo provide good example]

If you are a medium-sized or large municipality you can also work together with other municipalities or might want to have your own instance of OpenZaak managed by your local IT department. On the [developer](#) section there are some resources to [get you started](https://open-zaak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/index.html#installation-index) straight away.

If you need some inspiration and learn what kind of OpenZaak services are available in the market take a look at the
[Support](#) section. This section includes a list of vendors which provide different services ranging from hosting OpenZaak to OpenZaak Software-as-Service solutions or migration consultancy services.
