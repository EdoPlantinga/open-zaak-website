OpenZaak is an open-source case register platform for municipalites who want to deliver citizen-friendly services online.

OpenZaak implements the national API standards for case-oriented working (ZGW API's) developed by [VNG Realisatie](https://www.vngrealisatie.nl/). In order to fully utilize OpenZaak it needs to connect with other systems or components. Document management systems, or specialized systems to handle permits as well as the case handling component, MyApp or apps for MOR reports are examples of such systems and components.

OpenZaak itself is not a case management or document management solution but rather a ready-to-use backend solution which functions as a directory of case registration including meta data describing the case. OpenZaak implements the national API standards for case-oriented working ([ZGW API's](https://www.vngrealisatie.nl/producten/api-standaarden-zaakgericht-werken))  developed by [VNG Realisatie](https://www.vngrealisatie.nl/). In order to fully use OpenZaak it needs to connect with other systems or components. Document management systems, or specialized systems to handle permits as well as the case handling component, MyApp or apps for MOR reports are examples of such systems and components.

This means vendors can offer different types of services around OpenZaak. The most common types of services around OpenZaak are:

* Hosting services
* Software development services:
    * Integrate OpenZaak into your existing products and services
    * Create custom interfaces between OpenZaak and existing systems or 3rd party software applications
    * Create mobile applications on top of OpenZaak
* 1st and second line support services
* Project managenement & IT Consultancy

This means OpenZaak provides vendors with a number of business opportunities to offer their service and expertise to municipalities or other vendors in the OpenZaak community. Mobile application builders could buy hosting services for OpenZaak or vice versa is just one example. Other examples are companies who already offer (online) case and document management solutions to the market and implemented the OpenZaak back-end solution or have implemented the [ZGW API's](https://www.vngrealisatie.nl/producten/api-standaarden-zaakgericht-werken) from scratch.

As a vendor you also benefit from knowledge and the continued develpment and support within the OpenZaak community. Collabroation on the OpenZaak codebase is done in an open source project by an open and active community of municipalities, vendors and software developers and welcoming everyone who wants to participate and contribute towards making OpenZaak better. On the [developer](/developers) section and our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak) you can read [how to get started](https://open-zaak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/index.html#installation-index) and [contribute](https://github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Where do I start?

The best way to start is to  sign up sign up to the [OpenZaak mailinglist](https://lists.publiccode.net/mailman/postorius/lists/openzaak-discuss.lists.publiccode.net/) to get al the latest news around the OpenZaak codebase and community. Furthermore you can join the [OpenZaak community calls](#) to learn more and meet the OpenZaak community.

We also invite you to [join and participate our community](/community) and learn how other municipalities and vendors are using OpenZaak. 

## How can I integrate OpenZaak into my product or service?

The answer to this question largely depends on what kind of vendor you are and where you can offer the most value. Whether you are a full service IT vendor or software vendor. There are vendors who have decided to implement the ZGW API's from sratch and not relying on OpenZaak and there are vendors who integrated the OpenZaak codebased into their own product. Some vendors focus on hosting the back-end towards municipalities or even other vendors.

After reading the use cases start experimenting with the codebase by installing a local copy of OpenZaak to learn more. Reach out in the OpenZaak community.

## How can I sell my product or services? @TODO

This is of course up to you. You could develop a service with a subscription model or sell a service contract. Public organisations need to follow strict rules when procuring products and services. Procurement rules differ between municipalities. Small and mid-sized municipalities typically procure together through associations such as [Dimpact](https://www.dimpact.nl/).
